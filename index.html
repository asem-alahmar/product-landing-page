      <h1>Turkey</h1>
      <p>Turkey is situated at the crossroads of the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. It is among the larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population, and its land area is greater than that of any European state. Nearly all of the country is in Asia, comprising the oblong peninsula of Asia Minor—also known as Anatolia (Anadolu)—and, in the east, part of a mountainous region sometimes known as the Armenian Highland. The remainder—Turkish Thrace (Trakya)—lies in the extreme southeastern part of Europe, a tiny remnant of an empire that once extended over much of the Balkans. 
        Have you ever thought about traveling to Turkey?? !! 👍</p>

      <h2>I don't speak Turkish. Must I learn it?</h2>
      <p>Luckily, simple Turkish is fairly easy to learn because Turkish is a logical, phonetic language. All students in Turkish schools study English, and some even learn it. French, German and Arabic are also taught (and sometimes learned).</p>
